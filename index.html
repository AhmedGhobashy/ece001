            <th>Descreption</th>
            <th>These are the oldest forms of AI systems that have extremely limited capability. They emulate the human mind’s ability to respond to different kinds of stimuliThese machines do not have memory-based functionality. This means such machines cannot use previously gained experiences to inform their present actions, i.e., these machines do not have the ability to “learn.” These machines could only be used for automatically responding to a limited set or combination of inputs. They cannot be used to rely on memory to improve their operations based on the same. A popular example of a reactive AI machine is IBM’s Deep Blue, a machine that beat chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997.</th>
            <th>Limited memory machines are machines that, in addition to having the capabilities of purely reactive machines, are also capable of learning from historical data to make decisions.Nearly all existing applications that we know of come under this category of AI. All present-day AI systems, such as those using deep learning, are trained by large volumes of training data that they store in their memory to form a reference model for solving future problems. For instance, an image recognition AI is trained using thousands of pictures and their labels to teach it to name objects it scans. When an image is scanned by such an AI, it uses the training images as references to understand the contents of the image presented to it, and based on its “learning experience” it labels new images with increasing accuracy.</th>
            <th>While the previous two types of AI have been and are found in abundance, the next two types of AI exist, for now, either as a concept or a work in progress.Theory of mind AI is the next level of AI systems that researchers are currently engaged in innovating. A theory of mind level AI will be able to better understand the entities it is interacting with by discerning their needs, emotions, beliefs, and thought processes. While artificial emotional intelligence is already a budding industry and an area of interest for leading AI researchers, achieving Theory of mind level of AI will require development in other branches of AI as well. This is because to truly understand human needs, AI machines will have to perceive humans as individuals whose minds can be shaped by multiple factors, essentially “understanding” humans. </th>
            <th>This is the final stage of AI development which currently exists only hypothetically. Self-aware AI, which, self explanatorily, is an AI that has evolved to be so akin to the human brain that it has developed self-awareness.Creating this type of Ai, which is decades, if not centuries away from materializing, is and will always be the ultimate objective of all AI research. This type of AI will not only be able to understand and evoke emotions in those it interacts with, but also have emotions, needs, beliefs, and potentially desires of its own. And this is the type of AI that doomsayers of the technology are wary of. Although the development of self-aware can potentially boost our progress as a civilization by leaps and bounds, it can also potentially lead to catastrophe. This is because once self-aware, the AI would be capable of having ideas like self-preservation which may directly or indirectly spell the end for humanity, as such an entity could easily outmaneuver the intellect of any human being and plot elaborate schemes to take over humanity.</th>
            <th>This type of artificial intelligence represents all the existing AI, including even the most complicated and capable AI that has ever been created to date. Artificial narrow intelligence refers to AI systems that can only perform a specific task autonomously using human-like capabilities. These machines can do nothing more than what they are programmed to do, and thus have a very limited or narrow range of competencies. According to the aforementioned system of classification, these systems correspond to all the reactive and limited memory AI. Even the most complex AI that uses machine learning and deep learning to teach itself falls under ANI. </th>
            <th>Artificial General Intelligence is the ability of an AI agent to learn, perceive, understand, and function completely like a human being. These systems will be able to independently build multiple competencies and form connections and generalizations across domains, massively cutting down on time needed for training. This will make AI systems just as capable as humans by replicating our multi-functional capabilities. </th>
            <th>The development of Artificial Superintelligence will probably mark the pinnacle of AI research, as AGI will become by far the most capable forms of intelligence on earth.ASI, in addition to replicating the multi-faceted intelligence of human beings, will be exceedingly better at everything they do because of overwhelmingly greater memory, faster data processing and analysis, and decision-making capabilities. The development of AGI and ASI will lead to a scenario most popularly referred to as the singularity. And while the potential of having such powerful machines at our disposal seems appealing, these machines may also threaten our existence or at the very least, our way of life. </th>

    <h3>Intelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity. Aristotle's development of the syllogism and it's use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankind's quest to understand its own intelligence. While the roots are long and deep, the history of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans less than a century. The following is a quick look at some of the most important events in AI.</h3>
    1943<br /><br />
    Warren McCullough and Walter Pitts publish "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity." The paper proposed the first mathematic model for building a neural network.<br /><br />
    1949<br /><br />
    In his book The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory, Donald Hebb proposes the theory that neural pathways are created from experiences and that connections between neurons become stronger the more frequently they're used. Hebbian learning continues to be an important model in AI.<br /><br />
    1950<br /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence, proposing what is now known as the Turing Test, a method for determining if a machine is intelligent.</li>
        <li>Harvard undergraduates Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds build SNARC, the first neural network computer.</li>
        <li>Claude Shannon publishes the paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess."</li>
        <li>Isaac Asimov publishes the "Three Laws of Robotics."</li>
    </ul>
    1952<br /><br />
    Arthur Samuel develops a self-learning program to play checkers.<br /><br />
    1954<br /><br />
    The Georgetown-IBM machine translation experiment automatically translates 60 carefully selected Russian sentences into English.<br /><br />
    1956<br /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            The phrase artificial intelligence is coined at the "Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence." Led by John McCarthy, the conference, which defined the scope and goals of AI, is widely considered to be the birth of artificial intelligence as we know it today.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allen Newell and Herbert Simon demonstrate Logic Theorist (LT), the first reasoning program.
        </li>
    </ul>
    1958<br /><br />
    John McCarthy develops the AI programming language Lisp and publishes the paper "Programs with Common Sense." The paper proposed the hypothetical Advice Taker, a complete AI system with the ability to learn from experience as effectively as humans do.<br /><br />
    1959<br /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and J.C. Shaw develop the General Problem Solver (GPS), a program designed to imitate human problem-solving.</li>
        <li>
            Herbert Gelernter develops the Geometry Theorem Prover program.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arthur Samuel coins the term machine learning while at IBM.
        </li>
        <li> John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky found the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project</li>
    </ul>
    1963<br /><br />
    John McCarthy starts the AI Lab at Stanford.<br /><br />
    1966<br /><br />
    The Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (ALPAC) report by the U.S. government details the lack of progress in machine translations research, a major Cold War initiative with the promise of automatic and instantaneous translation of Russian. The ALPAC report leads to the cancellation of all government-funded MT projects.<br /><br />
    1969<br /><br />
    The first successful expert systems are developed in DENDRAL, a XX program, and MYCIN, designed to diagnose blood infections, are created at Stanford.<br /><br />
    1972<br /><br />
    The logic programming language PROLOG is created.<br /><br />
    1973<br /><br />
    The "Lighthill Report," detailing the disappointments in AI research, is released by the British government and leads to severe cuts in funding for artificial intelligence projects.<br /><br />
    1974-1980<br /><br />
    Frustration with the progress of AI development leads to major DARPA cutbacks in academic grants. Combined with the earlier ALPAC report and the previous year's "Lighthill Report," artificial intelligence funding dries up and research stalls. This period is known as the "First AI Winter."<br /><br />
    1980<br /><br />
    Digital Equipment Corporations develops R1 (also known as XCON), the first successful commercial expert system. Designed to configure orders for new computer systems, R1 kicks off an investment boom in expert systems that will last for much of the decade, effectively ending the first "AI Winter."<br /><br />
    1982<br /><br />
    Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry launches the ambitious Fifth Generation Computer Systems project. The goal of FGCS is to develop supercomputer-like performance and a platform for AI development.<br /><br />
    1983<br /><br />
    In response to Japan's FGCS, the U.S. government launches the Strategic Computing Initiative to provide DARPA funded research in advanced computing and artificial intelligence.<br /><br />
    1985<br /><br />
    Companies are spending more than a billion dollars a year on expert systems and an entire industry known as the Lisp machine market springs up to support them. Companies like Symbolics and Lisp Machines Inc. build specialized computers to run on the AI programming language Lisp.<br /><br />
    1987-1993<br /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>As computing technology improved, cheaper alternatives emerged and the Lisp machine market collapsed in 1987, ushering in the "Second AI Winter." During this period, expert systems proved too expensive to maintain and update, eventually falling out of favor.</li>
        <li>
            Japan terminates the FGCS project in 1992, citing failure in meeting the ambitious goals outlined a decade earlier.
        </li>
        <li>  DARPA ends the Strategic Computing Initiative in 1993 after spending nearly $1 billion and falling far short of expectations.</li>
    </ul>
    1991<br /><br />
    U.S. forces deploy DART, an automated logistics planning and scheduling tool, during the Gulf War.<br />
    1997<br /><br />
    IBM's Deep Blue beats world chess champion Gary Kasparov<br />
    2005<br /><br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            STANLEY, a self-driving car, wins the DARPA Grand Challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
            The U.S. military begins investing in autonomous robots like Boston Dynamic's "Big Dog" and iRobot's "PackBot."
        </li>
    </ul>
    2008<br /><br />
    Google makes breakthroughs in speech recognition and introduces the feature in its iPhone app.<br /><br />
    2011<br /><br />
    IBM's Watson trounces the competition on Jeopardy!.<br /><br />
    2012<br /><br />
    Andrew Ng, founder of the Google Brain Deep Learning project, feeds a neural network using deep learning algorithms 10 million YouTube videos as a training set. The neural network learned to recognize a cat without being told what a cat is, ushering in breakthrough era for neural networks and deep learning funding.<br /><br />
    2014<br /><br />
    Google makes first self-driving car to pass a state driving test.<br /><br />
    2016<br /><br />
